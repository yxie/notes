# Investing

## Business Model
Small business: owner <= business <= customer
Large business: board of director <= CEO <= customer

## Value A Small Business
* Income statement (net income, earning) => profit
* Balance sheet (equity, book value) => margin of safety
* Cash flow statement

### Net Income and Profit
* Income = Total Revenue - Total Cost
* `Net Income (Earning)` = Income - Taxes
* `Return (Profit)` = `Earning Per Share` =  Net Income / Market Price

### Balance Sheet and Margin of Safety
* Balance sheet = What would happen if the business liquidated right now?
* `Equity` = Total Asset - Total Liability
* `Margin of Safety` = `Book Value Per Share` = Equity / Market Price

### What is a share?
* `Shares Outstanding`: all the shares of a corporation, number of pieces that a company is divided into
* `Price to Earning (P/E)` = Market Price / Earning

## Stock Basics
### 4 rules
* A stock must be stable and understandable (not volatile)
* A stock must have long term prospects (a company that would still be around for 30+ years)
* A stock must be managed by vigilant leaders (stay away from companies with a lot of debts)
* A stock must be undervalued
  * Market Price (P)
  * Earning (E)
  * Book Value (BV)
  * P^2 / E / BV < 15*1.5

## Bonds
### Bond basics
* What is bond?
  * Similar to loan
  * Bond issuer, bank, investor
  * Par value, term, coupon rate, maturity
* Who uses bonds?
  * Companies
  * Governments (local, state, federal)
* Bond risks?
  * Company or government failure
  * Interest rates change, can affect the coupon rate of new bonds
  * Inflation
* Why are bonds lucrative?
  * Compare bond return and stock return
  * Buy bond when the interest rate is high, stock price is high
  * Buy stock when the interest rate is low, bond price is high

### Bond components
* Par/Face value, Coupon, Term
* Market value of a bond
  * Re-sell during the term
  * The bond market price approaches the par value as time progresses
  * When interest rate goes up, bond market price goes down

### How to value a bond and yield to maturity?
* Simple Interest
  * Adding up the value of all the coupons
  * `Coupon Yield` = 1 year coupon payment / Par Value
  * `Current Yield` = 1 year coupon payment / market price when purchased
* Compound Interest
  * Re-invest the coupon payments
* Current Yield
* Yield to Maturity
  * coupon payment, par gain/loss


## Stock
### Stock Market

## Risk and rewards
* Baseline value for risk and reward: `10 year federal note`
* Risks in investment
  * Excessive debt
  * Overpaying for an investment
  * Not knowing what you are doing

## Inflation
### Why does the government inflate the money?
* A moderate amount of inflation protects the country from deep recessions
* It serves as an indirect form of taxation

### What's the primary cause of inflation?
* The FED increases the money supply
* Methods
  * Print more money
  * Decrease the bank reserve ratio:
    `money available in the market = money saved / reserve ratio`

### Impact of inflation
* Bond: actual bond yield = bond yield - inflation rate
* Stock: price & earning both increases, no impact in general for stocks without debt

## Bond Credit Rating
* Moody's, S&P, Fitch

## Yield Curve
* https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-Yield-Data-Visualization.aspx
* Flat/negative curve, high yield (e.g. 5%)=> FED wants to slow down the economy
* Positive curve, low yield (e.g. 1%) => FED wants to speed up the economy
